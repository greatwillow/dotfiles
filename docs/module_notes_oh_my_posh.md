### Oh My Posh

**Theming**
For OMP themes, go [here](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes)

**Issues**
OMP is initialized in the bottom of the `env.nu` file with the following script:

`oh-my-posh init nu --config ~/.config/oh-my-posh/themes/catppuccin_mocha.omp.json --print | save ~/oh-my-posh-init.nu --force`

Here, OMP is taking the catpuccin_mocha theme config and saving it with an autogenerated initialization script `oh-my-posh-init.nu`.  In this special case, we are accessing this file from the user root directory instead of the `.config` directory.  This is because there were some issue with OMP writing to the `.config` directory.  

**Manual Steps**
An important note here is that the `~/oh-my-posh-init.nu` file must be created manually to allow this file to be written to.  This is because there were issues making this work in nushell.  Note also that the terminal may need to be opened twice initially before the initial config takes effect.
Also, note that the Nix installed Nerd Font may need to be set up to be used in the given terminal emulator to allow for OMP to work properly.
